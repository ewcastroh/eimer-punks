# PlatziPunks
PlatziPunks is a developed project based on CryptoPunks.

PlatziPunks is an NFT Marketplace created from saved data in the blockchain and shown through a deployed application in a decentralized file system.

PlatziPunks is based on generative art, i.e., all data will be in the Smart Contract. This data will be shown through a dApp which can be accessed by a decentralized storage file system from a browser.

This project is based on the open-source library [Avataaars](https://avataaars.com), developed byÂ Pablo Stanley.


Graphical elements combined with code will be used to generate images within a smart contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
